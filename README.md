That's it!  A browser should open automatically but if it doesn't, open one and go to `http://localhost:3000/`.  Start typing in the input to find a stock by symbol or name.  It will populate matching stocks as options below the input.  Select one of those or type in the stock symbol you wish to search for.  Press `Enter` or the `Check Stock` to see a candlestick chart with the last 30 days of that stock's activity.  Press the `Clear` button to reset the search and chart.
